# Microservices Feature Plan & Architecture

---

## 1. Order Service

### Features
- **Auth**
    - Signup, Signin (register, login)
    - Security with JWT (authentication & authorization)
- **Order Management**
    - Create Order (validate input, save to DB)
    - Get Order by User (support pagination and filtering)
- **Event Handling**
    - Publish event `OrderCreated` after successfully creating an order
    - Listen to events from Delivery Service (e.g. `DeliveryStatusUpdated`) to update order status
- **Additional Recommendations**
    - Publish events for order cancellation or updates if needed
    - Provide API for users to check order, delivery, and payment status (optional)
    - Implement error handling and retry logic for event publishing

---

## 2. Payment Service

### Features
- **Payment Processing**
    - Confirm payment (process payment requests)
    - Validate payment methods and update payment status
- **Event Handling**
    - Listen for `OrderCreated` events from Order Service to initiate payment processing
    - Publish `PaymentCompleted` event when payment is successful
    - Publish `PaymentFailed` event on payment failure
- **Additional Recommendations**
    - Integrate with real or mock payment gateways
    - Implement error handling and retry logic for event consumption and publishing
    - Provide API for checking payment status (optional)

---

## 3. Delivery Service

### Features
- **Delivery Management**
    - Listen for `PaymentCompleted` events from Payment Service to start delivery process
    - Update delivery order status (e.g., shipping, tracking)
    - Publish events like `DeliveryStarted`, `Delivered` for status updates
- **Event Handling**
    - Implement robust event listener with error handling and retries
- **Additional Recommendations**
    - Provide API for delivery status/tracking
    - Design models for various delivery statuses

---

## 4. Notification Service

### Features
- **Notification Handling**
    - Listen for `DeliveryStatusUpdated` events from Delivery Service
    - Send notifications to users (email, SMS, push notifications, or websocket)
- **Additional Recommendations**
    - Use queue system for high volume notification handling
    - Provide API for notification history (optional)
    - Implement retry mechanism for failed notifications

---

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

- **Logging & Monitoring**
    - Implement centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack)
    - Use monitoring tools like Prometheus, Grafana
- **Configuration Management**
    - Use centralized config management (Spring Cloud Config, Consul)
- **Health Checks**
    - Provide health endpoints, integrate Spring Boot Actuator
- **Metrics**
    - Track event publish/consume rates and service metrics

---

## Event & Data Flow Considerations

- Define clear event schemas with versioning
- Use shared contracts or libraries for event payloads to avoid mismatches
- Design for eventual consistency due to asynchronous event-driven model
- Secure event communication (e.g., Kafka ACLs, JWT in message headers)

---

## Additional Notes

- Each microservice manages its own database schema (no sharing of entity/repository classes)
- Communication and data synchronization between services happen via events
- Handle retries and error scenarios carefully to maintain data integrity and consistency

If you want, I can help you design sample event payloads or provide example Spring Boot code snippets for publishing and consuming events.
